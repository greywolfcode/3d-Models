I added the rudder, keel, and bow post to the ship, as well as adding some sloped railing sections and rounding the bottom of the ship. This does unfortunately add overhangs, but i kept the keel very thin and made the railings a solid piece to reduce them as much as possible.

I started making the base for the ship, and the sail. The sail will slot into the mast with a square peg in order to make it easier to print. The ship does have a slant outward in order to make it look more ship-like. The angle is only 10°, so hopefully it will not be a problem.
