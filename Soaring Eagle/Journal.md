Shaped the wings to have proper curves and be much thinner, and then shaped the tail to be thinner and have a slight curve. I started trying to shape the head and body to fit the wings, but they still need some work. The spherical head might need to be swapped out. At the moment it does look a little like an airplane, but hopefully feathers will fix that in the future.

Updated the tail to be larger and connected to the wings. A base shape for the head and neck has been added as well, although no beak yet.

I started blocking out the basic layout of the body. The wings will be slimmed down and shaped properly later, as will the tail. There were a few problems with a non-manifold body adding the transition from body to wings, as it happened I missed a section when extruding. My reference material for the shape is searching "eagle wings" in Google.
