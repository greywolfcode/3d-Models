I started blocking out the basic layout of the body. The wings will be slimmed down and shaped properly later, as will the tail. There were a few problems with a non-manifold body adding the transition from body to wings, as it happened I missed a section when extruding. My reference material for the shape is searching "eagle wings" in Google.
